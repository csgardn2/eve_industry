This project is simply a tool for converting a static data export from CCP
containing blueprint data to a format that is usable by the eve_industry tool.

Path to CCP's static blueprint data export (SDE) downloaded from
https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources.
As of writting, the blueprint file is in sde/fsd/blueprints.yaml
after extracting the SDE zip.
